KeyFinder 
=========
by Jared Rulison

GUI that finds keys of songs.  Parses a textbox into which lyrics and chords can be pasted (like from www.ultimate-guitar.com).

Ignores lyrics, and can understand chords of the following format:
(X is A,A#,Bb,B,C...)
X, Xm, X7, X6, X5, X9, XM7

Good sample chords to paste for testing:

Bm                Bm/A
Help! I need somebody 
G                 G/F#
Help! Not just anybody
E
Help! You know I need someone,
A
Help!


A                            C#m               F#m
When I was younger, so much younger than today,
                          D       G   A
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
                                C#m                 F#m
But now those days are gone I'm not so self-assured,
                                        D    G       A
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the door.


 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#  
Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.
 E                                                  A
Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.


                              C#m                   F#m
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
                           D     G       A
My independence seemed to vanish in the haze.
                         C#m                 F#m
But every now and then I feel so insecure,  
                                        D    G     A
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.


 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#
Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.
 E                                                 A
Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.


A                            C#m               F#m
When I was younger, so much younger than today,
                          D       G   A

                                C#m                 F#m
But now those days are gone I'm not so self-assured,
                                        D    G       A
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the door.


 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#

 E                                                  A               F#m
Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.
              A    A6
Help me, help me, ooo.
