KeyFinder 
=========
by Jared Rulison

GUI that finds keys of songs.  Parses a textbox into which lyrics and chords can be pasted (like from www.ultimate-guitar.com).

Ignores lyrics, and can understand chords of the following format:
(X is A,A#,Bb,B,C...)
X, Xm, X7, X6, X5, X9, XM7

Good sample chords to paste for testing:

Can't buy me love,      love,   
              Dm7  G7
Can't buy me love.


     C7                                         
I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend, if it makes you feel alright.
     F7                                 C7
I'll get you anything my friend, if it makes you feel alright.
      G7              F7                                       C7
Cause I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love.


      C7                                       
I'll give you all I've got to give, if you say you love me too.
  F7                                     C7
I may not have a lot to give but what I got I'll give to you.
G7              F7                                   C7
I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love.   
    

              Em  Am     C7
Can't buy me love,    everybody tells me so. 
              Em  Am Dm7         G7
Can't buy me love,   no, no, no, no.


 C7                                        
Say you don't need no diamond rings and I'll be satisfied.
F7                                             C7
Tell me that you want the kind of things that money just can't buy.
G7              F7                                   C7
I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love.
